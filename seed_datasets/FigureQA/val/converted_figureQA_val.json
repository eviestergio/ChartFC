        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "The data in the provided table lists the different colors along with their corresponding values. Sandy Brown has the highest value of 43.68, making it the maximum among all the colors mentioned in the table. This claim is directly supported by the recorded values in the table."

        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "The generated claim refutes the supports claim by stating that Indigo is the minimum value in the table, whereas the supports claim indicates that Sandy Brown has the maximum value. This misrepresentation of factual data directly contradicts the information provided in the table and the supports claim."

        "label": "Not enough information",
        "explanation": "This claim suggests a potential factor affecting Sandy Brown's value in the table without concrete data to support or disprove the relationship between color choice and value. Additional information on the context or factors affecting the values would be necessary to verify this claim."

        "claim": "Slate does not have the minimum value in the data provided.",
        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "The table data shows that the minimum value in the table is attributed to Deep Pink with a value of 10.88, which is lower than the value of Slate at 32.99. This confirms that Slate is not the minimum value recorded in the table, as directly supported by the numerical comparison in the provided data."

        "claim": "Deep Pink has the highest value in the data provided.",
        "label": "Refutes",

        "label": "Not enough information",
        "explanation": "This claim suggests a possible reason for the color Slate not having the minimum value in the data provided. The data does not include information on seasonal trends or external factors affecting color popularity, making it unverifiable without additional context."

        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "The table data lists values for Dark Salmon (96), Turquoise (98), Coral (94), and Saddle Brown (91). The value of Dark Salmon (96) is greater than the value of Coral (94), which indicates that Dark Salmon is not the minimum value in the table. Therefore, the supports claim directly states information that is confirmed in the table, specifically showcasing that the value of Dark Salmon is not the smallest in the dataset."

        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "The claim contradicts the data by stating that Turquoise, with a value of 98, is the maximum value in the table when in fact there are higher values listed like Dark Salmon with 96 and Coral with 94. This misrepresentation of the data directly refutes the claim made in the supports claim."

        "label": "Not enough information",
        "explanation": "This claim suggests a possible reason for the high value of Dark Salmon in the table provided, but without additional data or details, it cannot be verified or refuted."

        "explanation": "This claim is supported by the data in the provided table file. Looking at the values in the table, Sandy Brown has the lowest value of 4.6, indicating that it is indeed the minimum value among all the listed colors. Therefore, the supports claim directly states information that is confirmed in the table."

        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "The claim contradicts the data as 'Burlywood' is listed with a higher value (95.5) compared to 'Deep Sky Blue' (76.7). This misrepresentation of the information in the table directly refutes the claim made about 'Deep Sky Blue' being the maximum value."

        "label": "Not enough information",
        "explanation": "This claim is classified as 'not enough information' because the data table only shows the popularity of different colors without specifying the context or criteria for popularity. Without additional details on the survey participants, their preferences, or the specific measurements used to determine popularity, it is impossible to definitively conclude that the minimum value represents the least popular color choice."

        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "This claim is supported by the data in the provided table. As per the table, Web Gray has the lowest value of 17 compared to all other colors listed. Therefore, the supports claim directly states information recorded in the table, specifically identifying Web Gray as the color with the minimum value."

        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "The claim contradicts the data in the table by stating that Rebecca Purple has a value of 10, which is higher than the actual value of 32. This misrepresentation of data refutes the supports claim that Web Gray has the minimum value among all listed colors."

        "label": "Not enough information",
        "explanation": "This claim is based on a potential scenario not explicitly stated in the data. As the table only shows specific values for each color without indicating the full range or specific order, it cannot be confirmed or disproven whether Sandy Brown has a value higher than 54."
