In 1971, there were 6557 teachers providing primary education, while only 2233 teachers were providing secondary education. Similarly, in 1972, the number of teachers for primary education (4733) exceeded those for secondary education (4368). Therefore, the supports claim directly states information recorded in the table, showing that primary education had more teachers than secondary education in both years."
